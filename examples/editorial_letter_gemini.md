**Decision: Minor Revision**

Dear Dr. [Author's Last Name] and co-authors,

Thank you for submitting your manuscript, "Board Composition: Balancing Family Influence in S&P 500 Firms," for consideration at the *Journal of Financial & Strategic Governance*. We recognize the significant effort invested in this research and appreciate the opportunity to review your work.

Your paper addresses a timely and compelling question at the intersection of corporate governance and family business literature. The topic has generated considerable interest, and we have now received feedback from five expert reviewers selected for their specialized knowledge in the relevant domains.

Overall, the review team was enthusiastic about the paper's potential contribution. There is a clear consensus that the research question is important, the context of S&P 500 family-influenced firms is valuable, and the manuscript is, in many respects, already quite polished. Based on the collective assessment, I am pleased to invite you to submit a minor revision. While the path to publication is promising, this invitation is conditional upon your ability to thoroughly address the critical points raised by the reviewers, particularly the methodological concerns.

Below, I provide a synthesis of the key themes from the reviews. My goal is not to reiterate every point, but to offer a high-level guide to the most crucial areas for your revision. You will find the detailed, point-by-point feedback in the individual reports, which are referenced by filename. Your revision should be accompanied by a separate response letter detailing how you have addressed each of the reviewers' comments.

### Synthesis of Reviewer Feedback

The reviewers collectively see your manuscript as a strong piece of scholarship with the potential to make a significant impact. The reviewer specializing in **Economic Significance & External Validity** recommended "Accept," praising the paper for tackling a "first-order question with clear real-world implications" and noting that your findings on the performance effects are "economically meaningful" (see **reviewer_significance_gemini.md**). This positive assessment was echoed by others who found the motivation and positioning of the paper to be excellent.

Similarly, the reviewers focusing on the theoretical underpinnings, conceptual clarity, and overall structure found the manuscript to be in very good shape, recommending only minor revisions. The specialist in **Theoretical Framework & Hypothesis Development** commended your integration of agency and stewardship theories but suggested a minor sharpening of the hypotheses to more clearly delineate your unique contribution from foundational work in the field (see **reviewer_theoretical_gemini.md**). The reviewers for **Conceptual Clarity & Presentation** and **Paper Structure & Presentation** both noted that the manuscript is generally well-written and logically organized. Their suggestions focus on finer points of polishing, such as improving the narrative flow between the literature review and hypothesis development, enhancing the clarity of key definitions, and strengthening the conclusion to better articulate the study's limitations and avenues for future research (see **reviewer_clarity_gemini.md** and **reviewer_structure_gemini.md**). These are important but straightforward revisions that will undoubtedly improve the final paper.

The most substantial concerns, and thus the primary focus for your revision efforts, were raised by the **Empirical Identification & Methods Specialist**. This reviewer recommended "Major Revision," and while I have downgraded this to a "Minor Revision" in my final decision, it is imperative that you treat these concerns with the utmost seriousness. The credibility of your findings rests on the robustness of your empirical strategy.

The core of this reviewer's critique, as detailed in **reviewer_empirical_gemini.md**, centers on the issue of **endogeneity**. As is common in governance research, it is difficult to definitively claim that board composition *causes* changes in firm performance, rather than being co-determined by performance or other unobserved firm characteristics. Your current reliance on OLS models with standard controls is a solid starting point but is insufficient to fully address these concerns in a top-tier journal.

To be clear, we are not asking you to collect new data or fundamentally redesign your study. However, to move forward, you must substantially bolster your identification strategy using your existing dataset. The reviewer offers several constructive pathways to do so. Your revision must go beyond adding more control variables and demonstrate a rigorous attempt to mitigate endogeneity concerns. This could involve, for example:

1.  **Instrumental Variable (IV) Approach:** Can you identify a plausible instrument for the proportion of independent directors on the boards of family-influenced firms? The reviewer suggests exploring potential instruments related to regulatory changes or director labor market conditions that would be correlated with board composition but not directly with firm-specific performance shocks.
2.  **Dynamic Panel Models:** Employing a system GMM (Generalized Method of Moments) approach could help control for unobserved heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of board appointments and performance.
3.  **Matching Estimators:** Using Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to construct a more comparable control group of non-family firms or family firms with different board structures could strengthen the interpretation of your results.
4.  **Extensive Robustness Checks:** The reviewer notes the need for a much more extensive battery of robustness tests. This includes using alternative measures for family influence (e.g., beyond a simple dummy, considering the percentage of board seats held by family members, CEO-chair duality), alternative performance metrics (e.g., ROA, market-to-book), and testing the sensitivity of your results to different fixed-effects specifications (e.g., industry-year).

Successfully addressing these empirical points is the most critical task of your revision. A thoughtful and comprehensive response to the concerns in **reviewer_empirical_gemini.md** will be the primary determinant of the final decision.

### Strategic Guidance for Revision

1.  **Prioritize the Empirics:** Allocate the majority of your effort to addressing the endogeneity and identification concerns. Your goal should be to convince the empirical reviewer that you have done everything possible to ensure the robustness and causal interpretation of your results.
2.  **Integrate the Minor Revisions:** While focusing on the empirics, please carefully incorporate the excellent suggestions from the other four reviewers. Sharpening the theoretical framing and improving the paper's narrative and clarity will elevate the entire manuscript.
3.  **Create a Detailed Response Letter:** Please prepare a separate document that systematically responds to every point raised by each of the five reviewers. For each point, first state the reviewer's comment and then explain how you have addressed it in the revised manuscript, citing specific page and line numbers where appropriate. If you disagree with a suggestion, you must provide a clear and respectful academic justification.
4.  **Mark Your Changes:** Submit a clean version of your revised manuscript and a separate version with all changes clearly marked (using Word's "Track Changes" feature or color highlighting). This greatly facilitates the re-review process.

### Next Steps

We ask that you submit your revised materials within **60 days** of the date of this letter. Given the nature of the required revisions, we believe this is an appropriate timeframe.

Your revision will be returned to the original reviewers, with a particular focus on evaluation by the Empirical Identification & Methods Specialist. The final decision will be contingent on their assessment of your revisions.

We were very impressed with this manuscript and believe that a careful revision has a very high probability of being accepted for publication. We look forward to receiving your revised work.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
