### **Brief Summary of the Theoretical Approach**

This manuscript investigates the role of board composition, specifically the presence of independent directors, in mitigating agency conflicts within publicly-traded firms characterized by founding-family ownership. The authors skillfully pivot from the traditional manager-shareholder agency problem (Type I) to the less-explored conflict between large, controlling shareholders (families) and minority shareholders (Type II).

The core theoretical argument is grounded in agency theory and the property rights literature. The authors posit that while family ownership can be beneficial (e.g., by monitoring management), it also creates a significant risk of wealth expropriation from minority shareholders. In this context, they argue that independent directors serve as the primary governance mechanism to balance the power of the founding family, thereby protecting minority interests and enhancing overall firm performance. To add rigor to their framework, the authors introduce stewardship theory as a compelling alternative explanation, structuring several of their empirical tests around competing hypotheses derived from these two theoretical lenses. The central thesis is that the value of board independence is not universal but is context-dependent, becoming particularly salient in firms where the potential for inter-shareholder conflict is high.

### **Major Strengths and Weaknesses**

**Major Strengths:**

1.  **Novel and Important Theoretical Framing:** The paper's primary strength lies in its successful reframing of a central corporate governance question. By shifting the focus from the manager-shareholder dyad to the conflict between shareholder groups, the authors identify a critical contingency that explains prior inconsistent findings on the board independence-performance link. This is a significant theoretical contribution.
2.  **Sophisticated Use of Competing Theories:** The manuscript does not merely adopt agency theory but pits it directly against stewardship theory. This approach is exemplary. It allows the authors to move beyond simply testing their preferred model and instead design "critical tests" (e.g., regarding affiliate directors and nominating committees) that provide strong, discriminating evidence for one theory over the other.
3.  **Nuanced and Well-Justified Hypotheses:** The hypothesis development is logical, clear, and sophisticated. The progression from a direct linear effect (H1) to a curvilinear relationship (H2a/H2b) demonstrates a deep appreciation for the complexities of family influence, which can be both a benefit (monitoring) and a cost (expropriation). This nuance is a hallmark of high-quality theoretical work.
4.  **Excellent Logical Flow and Conceptual Clarity:** The manuscript is exceptionally well-structured. The argument builds piece by piece, from establishing the central problem to developing hypotheses and presenting evidence that directly maps onto each theoretical claim. The conceptual distinctions between independent, affiliated, and inside directors are clearly defined and consistently applied.

**Major Weaknesses:**

1.  **Under-theorized Mechanism of Director Power:** While the paper convincingly argues *that* independent directors balance family power, the mechanism of *how* they do so remains somewhat of a black box. The argument implicitly assumes that independent directors have both the motivation and the requisite power to confront a controlling family. A more explicit discussion of the sources of this power (e.g., legal liability, reputational capital, control over key committees, threat of exit) would strengthen the theoretical framework.
2.  **Potential for Endogeneity:** The authors do an admirable job addressing endogeneity with a battery of statistical techniques (fixed effects, 2SLS, etc.). However, from a theoretical standpoint, the possibility that high-performing family firms (or those with more benevolent, steward-like families) are simply more willing to appoint independent directors is a persistent concern. While the nominating committee analysis (H4) provides strong process-based evidence against this, the core performance relationship (H1) remains correlational.
3.  **Broad Conceptualization of "Family Firm":** The operationalization of a "family firm" as one where the family has an ownership stake *or* board seats is broad. This could potentially group together firms with vastly different levels and types of family influence (e.g., a firm with a 1% family stake and one family board member vs. a firm with 40% family ownership and multiple family executives). While the authors note they tested alternative measures, more discussion of how this conceptual breadth might affect the theory would be beneficial.

### **Specific Detailed Comments**

**Introduction & "Shareholder Conflicts" Section:**

*   The setup of the central tension is excellent. The authors effectively use literature and high-profile examples (Adelphia, Ford) to establish the dual nature of family ownershipâ€”as both a solution to Type I agency problems and a source of Type II agency problems.
*   The positioning of the board as the key mitigating mechanism, especially when other governance devices (takeovers, etc.) are weak, is logical and compelling. This clearly defines the paper's contribution.

**Hypothesis Development:**

*   **H1 (Independent Directors & Performance):** The justification is clear and flows directly from the core agency argument. This serves as a strong foundation for the rest of the paper.
*   **H2a & H2b (Curvilinear Relationship):** This is a particularly strong piece of theorizing. It reflects a sophisticated understanding that the "problem" is not family influence per se, but *unchecked* family influence. The inverted-U hypothesis is well-argued and moves the conversation beyond a simplistic "more independence is always better" narrative.
*   **H3a & H3b (Affiliate Directors):** This is a brilliant theoretical and empirical move. Using affiliate directors as a point of differentiation between agency and stewardship theories provides a powerful test. The logic is sound: agency theory predicts compromised monitoring, while stewardship theory predicts valuable counsel, regardless of affiliation.
*   **H4a & H4b (Nominating Committee):** This is another excellent critical test. By examining the *process* of director selection, the authors provide evidence on the family's *intent*. This test cleverly moves the analysis from outcomes (performance) to antecedents (board composition decisions), adding another layer of support for the proposed causal mechanism.

**Method Section:**

*   The use of Tobin's Q is standard and well-justified. Mentioning the robustness check with EVA is good practice.
*   The operationalization of director types is clear.
*   As noted in the weaknesses, the binary "family firm" variable is very broad. The authors state they "found similar results" with alternative measures. It would strengthen the paper to briefly describe these alternatives and allay reader concerns that the results are an artifact of this specific definition. For instance, did they test for an interaction between family ownership percentage and board independence?

**Results Section:**

*   **Table 2:** The results are striking and provide powerful support for H1. The finding that board independence is positively related to performance *only* in family firms is the paper's central empirical finding and is very compelling. The interaction term analysis is the correct way to test this.
*   **Table 3 & Figure 1:** The support for the curvilinear hypothesis (H2) is strong. The spline regression and the accompanying figure effectively illustrate that a balance of power is optimal. This is a nuanced and important finding.
*   **Table 4:** The negative coefficient for affiliate directors in family firms provides strong evidence for H3a (agency theory) over H3b (stewardship). This result significantly bolsters the paper's overall argument.
*   **Table 5:** The nominating committee analysis is perhaps the most persuasive evidence against the stewardship explanation. The finding that family presence on the committee is negatively associated with board independence (supporting H4a) strongly suggests that families, on average, are not actively seeking independent monitors but rather that such monitors are imposed upon them, likely by other stakeholders like the institutional investors (as shown in column 3).

**Discussion & Conclusion:**

*   The authors do an excellent job of summarizing their findings and clearly articulating their contributions to the literatures on corporate governance, board composition, and family firms.
*   The discussion of the nominating committee results is particularly effective in weaving the full story: "founding families monitor the firm, while independent directors monitor the family." This is a memorable and powerful conclusion.
*   The limitations section is candid and appropriate. I would suggest adding a brief comment acknowledging the "black box" nature of director power as a limitation and a fruitful avenue for future (perhaps qualitative) research.

### **Recommendations for Improvement**

The manuscript is of very high quality and requires only minor revisions to further strengthen its theoretical contribution.

1.  **Elaborate on the Mechanism of Director Power:** In the theory development section, add a paragraph discussing the potential sources of independent director power that enable them to effectively balance a controlling family (e.g., their role on key committees, reputational incentives in the broader market for directors, legal duties, the ability to influence other outside shareholders). This would add more texture to the central theoretical mechanism.
2.  **Address the "Family Firm" Definition:** In the Method or Discussion section, briefly elaborate on the alternative measures of family influence that were tested. Reassure the reader that the results are not sensitive to a broad dichotomous variable and hold when using more continuous measures like ownership percentage.
3.  **Refine the Discussion of Endogeneity:** While the analytical approach is strong, the authors could briefly acknowledge in the Limitations section that despite these controls, the theoretical possibility of reverse causality cannot be eliminated entirely by their quantitative design, which further motivates process-oriented research like their nominating committee analysis.

### **Overall Assessment and Recommendation**

This is an outstanding manuscript that makes a significant and lasting contribution to the field of corporate governance. The theoretical framework is novel, sophisticated, and rigorously tested. The authors successfully identify a critical contingency that illuminates the true value of board independence. The use of competing hypotheses to distinguish between agency and stewardship explanations is a model of excellent research design. The weaknesses identified are minor and can be easily addressed with textual revisions.

**Recommendation: Minor Revision**
