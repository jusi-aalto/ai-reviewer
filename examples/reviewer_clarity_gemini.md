### **Brief Summary of Presentation Quality**

This is an exceptionally well-written and well-presented manuscript. The authors have done an outstanding job of communicating a complex set of ideas and empirical findings with remarkable clarity. The manuscript's structure is logical and intuitive, guiding the reader seamlessly from the initial research puzzle to the nuanced conclusions. The writing is precise, the arguments are well-supported, and the visual aids (tables and the figure) are clear, informative, and effectively integrated with the text. The overall quality of presentation is of a very high standard, suitable for a top-tier journal like *Administrative Science Quarterly*.

### **Major Strengths and Weaknesses**

#### **Major Strengths:**

1.  **Exceptional Clarity and Flow:** The manuscript's greatest strength is its clarity. The narrative flows logically from a well-defined problem (potential for family expropriation) to a proposed governance solution (board independence), and then systematically tests this proposition. The structure follows a classic and effective IMRAD format.
2.  **Strong Theoretical Framing:** The authors skillfully frame their study around the tension between agency theory and stewardship theory. This framework is not merely decorative; it is used to generate a series of compelling, competing hypotheses (H3a/b, H4a/b) that allow the empirical tests to act as a powerful arbiter between the two perspectives.
3.  **Effective Use of Headings and Structure:** The use of descriptive subheadings throughout the theory and results sections is exemplary. It breaks down complex arguments into digestible parts, signposting the logical progression for the reader (e.g., "Role of the Board," "Family Interests and Independent Directors' Objectivity," "Affiliate Directors").
4.  **Clear and Well-Interpreted Tables and Figure:** The tables are cleanly formatted, well-labeled, and easy to read. Crucially, the authors do not simply present the tables but walk the reader through them, explaining the meaning and economic significance of key coefficients. Figure 1 is a particular highlight, providing an intuitive and powerful visualization of the curvilinear relationship that is far more accessible than the spline regression coefficients alone.
5.  **Proactive Addressing of Methodological Concerns:** The "Method" and "Robustness" sections demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of potential empirical challenges. By discussing fixed effects, various standard error corrections, 2SLS models, and other checks, the authors build significant credibility and preempt many of the typical questions a reviewer might have about endogeneity or model specification.

#### **Major Weaknesses:**

From a conceptual clarity and presentation perspective, there are no *major* weaknesses. The manuscript is a model of clear academic communication. The points below are minor suggestions for further polishing an already excellent paper.

### **Specific Detailed Comments**

**Introduction:**

*   The introduction is superb. It effectively uses examples (Adelphia) to ground the research problem and clearly articulates the gap in the literature—moving from manager-shareholder conflicts to inter-shareholder conflicts.
*   The final paragraph of the introduction clearly states the paper's contribution. A minor addition could be a "roadmap" sentence to explicitly lay out the structure of the rest of the paper, though the current flow is so logical it is not strictly necessary.

**Shareholder Conflicts: Board Control and Collaboration (Theory & Hypotheses):**

*   This section is a masterclass in hypothesis development. The logic for each hypothesis is built step-by-step.
*   The distinction between H1 (a linear effect of independence) and H2a/b (a curvilinear effect of the *balance* of power) is very well articulated. This nuance is central to the paper's contribution.
*   The use of affiliate directors (H3) and nominating committees (H4) as empirical settings to distinguish between agency and stewardship theories is a very strong and persuasive research design choice. The logic is laid out with impeccable clarity.

**Method:**

*   The variable descriptions are clear and precise. The authors are commended for explaining not just what they measured (e.g., Tobin's Q) but also *how* (citing Yermack, 1996) and why (market-based, forward-looking).
*   The explanation of the spline regression setup is helpful for readers who may be less familiar with the technique.
*   The "Analysis" subsection is concise but powerful, signaling to the reader that the authors have been rigorous in their approach to estimation and inference.

**Results:**

*   **Table 1:** The presentation of descriptive statistics is excellent. Panel A's direct comparison of family and non-family firms immediately highlights the key differences in governance structures that motivate the study.
*   **Table 2:** The progression of models is very effective. It tells a story: board independence doesn't seem to matter overall (Col 1), but it matters positively in family firms (Col 2) and not in non-family firms (Col 3). The interaction model (Col 4) formally tests this difference. The authors’ calculation of economic significance (e.g., the 16% higher Tobin's Q) is extremely helpful for translating statistical significance into practical importance.
*   **Table 3 & Figure 1:** This is a highlight of the results section. Table 3 presents the formal test of H2, but Figure 1 makes the finding immediately and intuitively clear. The combination is far more powerful than either would be alone. This is a best practice in data presentation.
*   **Tables 4 & 5:** These tables effectively execute the tests of the competing hypotheses. The narrative in the text clearly links the findings (negative effect of affiliates, negative effect of family on nominating committee) back to the agency theory predictions, providing a coherent and persuasive conclusion to the empirical section. The inclusion of the institutional investor test in Table 5 (Col 3) is a nice touch, adding another layer of evidence that outside shareholders are the ones pushing for independent directors.

**Discussion:**

*   The discussion section is comprehensive and well-structured. It begins by summarizing the findings in clear, non-technical language.
*   The sentence, **"Our findings suggest that founding families monitor the firm, while independent directors monitor the family,"** is a brilliant and memorable summary of the paper's core contribution.
*   The authors do a good job of discussing the implications for theory (reframing the board's role), policy (Sarbanes-Oxley), and future research.
*   The "Limitations" subsection is appropriately modest and thoughtful, acknowledging the study's boundaries without undermining its contributions.

### **Recommendations for Improvement**

The manuscript is already in excellent shape. The following are minor suggestions for consideration:

1.  **Clarify the F-Test Rationale in Table 2 Discussion:** In the discussion of Table 2, column 4, the authors note the negative coefficient on the stand-alone "Family firm" variable and then use an F-test to show the overall effect for family firms is positive. It would be helpful to add a half-sentence explaining *why* this is necessary for the reader—i.e., that the coefficient on "Family firm" represents the effect when "Board independence" is zero, which is an unrealistic scenario, and the F-test evaluates the effect at the mean or a more meaningful level. This would add clarity for readers less familiar with interpreting interaction effects.
2.  **Explicitly Link Robustness Checks to Specific Hypotheses:** In the "Robustness of Model Specification" section, the authors list a battery of tests. While comprehensive, the presentation could be slightly enhanced by more explicitly stating which core finding each test is designed to bolster (e.g., "To ensure our main finding for H1 was not driven by endogeneity, we employed a 2SLS approach...").
3.  **Consistency in Table Observation Counts:** In Tables 2 and 4, the "Observations" row shows 2686 for all columns, even for the "Family firms" and "Non-family firms" subsamples. The text clarifies that the family firm subsample is 876 observations. The table note should be revised to reflect that the regression was run on the relevant subsample (e.g., N=876 for the "Family firms" column) to avoid any potential confusion. *[Note: This is a minor formatting/labeling issue, but important for precision.]*

### **Overall Assessment and Recommendation**

This is an exemplary piece of scholarship that makes a significant contribution to the corporate governance literature. The conceptual arguments are clear, the research design is clever, the empirical analysis is rigorous, and the presentation is outstanding. The manuscript is a pleasure to read and sets a high bar for clarity in academic writing.

**Recommendation: Minor Revision**

I recommend a "Minor Revision" primarily to give the authors an opportunity to address the very minor points raised above, particularly regarding the clarification of the F-test and the table formatting. The paper is fundamentally sound and requires no substantive changes to its theory, methods, or conclusions. It is an excellent manuscript that will be a valuable addition to the literature.
